# WordPress Revision Limiter Plugin

Created a simple revision limiter for WordPress since a lot of similar plugins were behind paywalls.
It deletes old revisions based on the limit set and limits future revisions from exceeding the limit.

## Installation
Just drag the folder into your plugin folder. (htdocs > wp-content > plugins)

## Compatibility
Works with Gutenburg blocks and Visual Composer (so far with testing). Will have to further test other builders.

## IMPORTANT
Please backup your WordPress instance before deleting revisions, as it cannot be recoverable. I am not responsible for any loss of data.
